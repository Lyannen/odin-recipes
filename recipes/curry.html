    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe resembles Akira Hayama's Kozhi Varutha Curry from the anime <em>Food Wars</em>. It is comparable to an Indian Chicken Tikka Masala. We will cook chicken in a coconut-based sauce with several fried off spices.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deboned chicken thighs</li>
        <li>An onion</li>
        <li>Fresh garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Spices: Turmeric, Coriander seeds, Garam Masala, Cumin, Cayenne pepper, Sea salt</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Coconut milk</li>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sear the chicken on high heat until golden-brown. Don't worry about it not being cooked all the way through yet, we will continue steaming it in the sauce later.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and in its stead add garlic, onions and grated ginger.</li>
        <li>Add generous amounts of Cumin and Garam Masala to the pan. Add Coriander seeds to your liking. Give the spices a moment to really touch the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the canned tomatoes as well as the remaining spices.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and put the chicken back in. Let everything cook for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and garnish with Fresh coriander.</li>
    </ol>
